      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that
      arose from the red junglefowl, originally from India. They have also
      partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey
      junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl)
    </p>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster, and
      an adult female is called a hen.[9][10]
    </p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>
      According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e., a roosting bird)
      originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the
      sexual connotation of the original English cock,[22][23][24] and is widely
      used throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to
      sleep at night.[25]
    </p>
    <h2>Biology and habitat</h2>
    <p>
      Chickens are omnivores.[26] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to
      search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large as lizards, small
      snakes,[27] or sometimes young mice.[28] The average chicken may live for
      5â€“10 years, depending on the breed.[29] The world's oldest known chicken
      lived for 16 years, according to Guinness World Records.[30]

    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
    <p>
      Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a
      communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.
      Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a
      pecking order, with dominant individuals having priority for food access
      and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a
      temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is
      established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock
      can lead to fighting and injury.[citation needed] Chickens may
      occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator. At least one
      credible report exists of a young fox killed by hens.[32][33][34] If a
      chicken is threatened by predators, stress, or is sick, it may puff up its
      feathers.[35]
